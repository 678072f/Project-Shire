# Project-Shire Experimental Branch

Project-Shire is the code name for a mid-range, turboprop General Aviation airplane. It is being developed to carry up to 6 passengers plus bags up to 1000 NM, while being affordable and easy to fly.

The experimental branch contains the latest development builds and feature updates of the project. This contains untested and/or incomplete code and project attributes and should not be used as release versions. The testing versions will be found in the "dev" branch.

This project is intended to be used on a specific set of hardware and is not meant to be used outside of that purpose. Any use outside of the project scope is not supported.
